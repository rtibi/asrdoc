# Introduction
This document covers the steps for setting up and configuring Azure Site Recovery Services (ASR) for CSP partners using Azure Resource Manager for two Datacenter to Azure scenarios:

1. DC to Azure: Multitenant VMM. Suitable for Service Providers / Hosters that use VMM to service multiple tenants in the same shared infrastructure. This maps to Microsoft’s default Cloud OS Network deployments.
1. DC to Azure: Dedicated VMM per tenant. Suitable for large outsourcers where management plane is fully dedicated to one tenant.

# Prerequisites
The scenarios below represent validation testing done from the perspective of the tenant. They assume administrative / owner rights for the resources involved – both from the point of view of the CSP Azure-subscriptions and the EA/direct subscription.
1. Scenarios below require the following [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.microsoft.com/) subscriptions (note the TenantID and Subscription ID for each, these are used when switching the context of the user in Powershell):
  - A CSP subscription where at least 2 tenants are provisioned\* . Each tenant requires a Microsoft Azure subscription provisioned.
    ><small>\* This validation testing uses 2 tenants for better simulation of a real-world scenario. Each of these CSP tenants map to individual tenants a Service Provider may have.</small>

  - An EA/Direct/Azure Pass/trial subscription\* - If you don't have one, start with a [free trial](http://aka.ms/try-azure).
  > <small>\* Because using single ASR vault to service multiple CSP tenants constitute as a shared function, it has to be deployed into a non-CSP subscription that the Service Provider has. </small>
1. You'll need an Azure v2 storage (ARM) account to store data replicated to Azure. The account needs to have geo-replication enabled. As of December 2015, the storage account and the Azure Site Recovery service must be in the same region.
> To learn more about setting up Azure storage, see Introduction to [Microsoft Azure Storage](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398704).
1. You'll need to make sure that virtual machines you want to protect comply with Azure requirements. See [Virtual machine support](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn469078.aspx#BKMK_E2A) for details.
1. Ensure System Center 2012 R2 | Virtual Machine Manager has the AzureSiteRecoveryProvider version 5.1.1256.0 or later.

  > Note:
  * Latest version can be downloaded here: http://aka.ms/downloaddra
  * If the version is older, when trying to register the VMM server, an “unknown error” will occur while trying to read the certificate.
  * Do not assume the provider will be updated during the installation process: when installing the ASR Provider, there is a step stating that it’s “looking for the latest version” of the provider. As of December 2015, that step doesn’t do anything – it will actually update the agent to the latest version at a later time, as it’s on boarded to Microsoft Updates (not the case as of December 2015). That is why it is important to install the latest version of the Provider manually.

1. Once the plan is configured, make sure that all resources around ASR are in the same region (including the Azure Virtual Network, Storage Account and Resource Groups). More information on Azure regions can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/).
> Note:
  * As of December 2015, only VM level operations are possible and only through PowerShell. Support for recovery plan level operations are planned for a future release. Similarly, as of December 2015, performing failovers are limited to only at a per protected VM granularity and not at a Recovery Plan level.

## <a name="abdul1234"></a>VMM prerequisites
1. VMM server running on System Center 2012 R2 – with the latest updates and URs installed. This document was validated with a deployment that uses VMM 2012 R2 with UR7 and Windows Server 2012 R2 updates released through November 20, 2015.
1. Any VMM server managing virtual machines you want to protect must be running the Azure Site Recovery Provider. This is installed during the Azure Site Recovery provider deployment – in Step 4 of this document.
1. You'll need at least one cloud on the VMM server you want to protect. The cloud should contain:
  * One or more VMM host groups.
  * One or more Hyper-V host servers or clusters in each host group.
  * One or more virtual machines on the source Hyper-V server.
